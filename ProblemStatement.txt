Design a list in python which should accept only the given data type (Eg:Integer or float)
and also implement all the common function of list like append, extend, insert, pop . If user
gives any other data type it should not accept and pop up an error.
Note: Don’t use any third party API, we are looking for you to build an API for the above
problem and the API should be of configurable to accept any one of datatype or two.

For eg:
import mylist

mylist.acceptonly(‘int’) #it should accept integers only

new_list = mylist()

new_list.append(5) # it should produce output

new_list.append(5.0) # it should produce an error

Eg2: mylist.acceptonly((‘int’, ‘float’))
